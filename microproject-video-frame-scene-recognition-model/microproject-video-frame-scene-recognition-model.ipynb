In this MicroProject, you will create a simple model to detect the amount of time spent in two different \"scenes\" we used when creating office-hour style videos for Data Science DISCOVERY.  To do this, you will learn how to import an entire folder of images, preform image analysis, and create your own model without using a pre-build library.  Let's nerd out! :)\n","\n","> *This MicroProject was inspired by a podcast that we recently recorded with the team from the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning who helped produce our video.  To learn the background and hear from Karle and Wade about the journey of creating DISCOVERY, go over and listen to our episode on the \"Teach Talk Listen Learn Podcast\" where talk with TTLL host Bob Dignan and our CITL video producer Eric Schumacher: https://citl.illinois.edu/citl-101/teaching-learning/teach-talk-listen-learn*\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Loading Video Frames\n","\n","We have provided you with one frame every second from our video [*\"Outliers Impact on Correlation (m6-02b)\"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd6hQ2UcIJc) that is used as part of our [DISCOVERY lecture covering Correlation](https://discovery.cs.illinois.edu/learn/Towards-Machine-Learning/Correlation/).  Each of these frames are in the `frames` sub-folder.\n","\n","The `skimage` library is commonly used to load image data into Python.  Specifically:\n","\n","- The full function name we will be using is `skimage.io.imread(filename)`.  This function will read a filename and return the pixel color for every pixel in the image.\n","\n","- To use the `imread` function, you will need to either do one of the following:\n","\n","    1. Import the entire `skimage` library by using the import line: `import skimage`.  After importing all of `skimage`, you will call the function using it's fully qualified name: `skimage.io.imread(filename)`.\n","    \n","    **ALTERATIVELY**\n","    \n","    2.
